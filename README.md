### Hi there!👋 My name is Daniel Rajis™️




About me🚶🏾‍♂️:
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science at the University of Nottingham.
- 🧠 I'm always eager to learn from experienced seniors and professionals.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects, the most important being version 2.0 of my current portfollio website!
- 💻 I craft CSS/HTML portfolio websites, offering them to fellow students at no cost and extending the service to external clients for a 
     nominal fee. 

   😪Juggling personal time alongside rigorous computer science studies can be challenging. ![](bartstudy.gif)
